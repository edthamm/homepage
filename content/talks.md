I am available as a speaker for your conference.
If you are interested, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethamm).

You can find resources on talks I have previously held over on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/eduards-talks).

## Videos

You can find some of my talks on YouTube.
There is one titled [Introduction to Cloud Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg_E6yNL6g4), which is slightly longer,
and a short form one on how cloud opens up possibilities to security folks can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEbexeRWvoo).
