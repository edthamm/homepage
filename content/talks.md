I am available as a speaker for your conference or at your company.
If you are interested, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethamm).

## Previous Public Speaking

You can find resources on talks I have previously held over on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/eduards-talks).
There you will find talks on topics ranging from failure culture and the pitfalls of SOLID to threat hunting. Most are designed to be given in a 15-30 minute session, depending on how much room for discussion is desired.

## Videos

You can find some of my talks on YouTube.
There is one titled [Introduction to Cloud Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg_E6yNL6g4), which is slightly longer,
and a short form one on how the cloud opens up possibilities to security folks can be found [on the DSLAM YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEbexeRWvoo).
If you are interested in seeing me speak in a business context, there is a video available from one of my former employers on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/1h8ztwI1mj8?si=qENZZoekF6jM1dTI).
