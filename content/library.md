# The Library

I tend to think of books as long-form conversations.
Someone invested time and effort to write about something they care about, and I chose to spend time with their thoughts on the topic.
Some of the books below sharpened how I reason about systems, others about failure, risk,
or how groups of people actually work under pressure.

This page is a curated subset of books that influenced how I think and work.
It is intentionally incomplete and biased toward works I still reference mentally, if not explicitly.

The books are grouped by how I use them, not by genre. Inclusion in this list
does not imply agreement with everything in a given book, just that I continue to find them useful.

## Analysis, Decision-Making & Context

I tend to return to a small number of these books repeatedly.
Most influence comes less from reading than from revisiting ideas when context changes.
